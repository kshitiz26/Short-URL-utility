# Short-URL-utility
This utility will register a short URL for a given longer URL and store it. Users can invoke getUrl method to retrieve the longer URL based on the short URL.

URL shortening is a technique on the internet in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) can be made substantially shorter and still direct you to the required page. This shorter URL makes it easier to distribute the link.

This is achieved by using a URL Shortening service/utility which takes the longer URL as input and generates a shorter URL for it. When the Short URL is used to open the webpage, the utility gets this request and redirects you to the web page of the corresponding longer URL.
